### The Problem

The Internet today has become a hotspot for extremist outfits to recruit new members and spread hate. Over the last decade, there has been increase in the amount of extremist outfits using Internet to spew hatred and recruit vulnerable youth in strife-torn region around the world

### The Cause

Drawing lessons from various researches on the recruitment strategies of these orginzations from a psychological perspective, Arie Kruglanski, a cognitive psychology reaseacher at MIT suggests that the _“appeal of violent extremism derives from a clever exploitation of two basic human needs: the need for cognitive closure and the need for personal significance.” [\[1\]](http://www.start.umd.edu/news/dr-arie-kruglanski-discusses-psychology-behind-terrorist-recruitment)_

#### 

Extremist groups offer a cause to join. Ideology is very important but it is also about how people feel about the society they live in, according to experts. The appeal doesn’t begin with violence. It begins with doing something significant, focusing on being someone important. Once a young adult buys in big time, they’re willing to take extreme measures on behalf of the cause. They want to prove they belong.

### One of the biggest challenge that we are trying to solve is giving these youth the opportunity to invest their life in something big. Read below to understand how we tackle this challenge
