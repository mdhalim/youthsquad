One of the biggest challenge that we are trying to  solve is giving these youth the opportunity to invest their life in something big. Extremist groups offer a cause to join. Ideology is very important but it is also about how people feel about the society they live in, according to experts. The appeal doesn’t begin with violence. It begins with doing something significant, focusing on being someone important. Once a young adult buys in big time, they’re willing to take extreme measures on behalf of the cause. They want to prove they belong.
