# Want to become a Software Developer? Here’s how to get there

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*ZdNEfHnKwd2B8zLkFOhhqg.jpeg)

*“How do I become a developer?” —* I’ve heard this question a lot, so I decided
to write the **best guide I can**, **using only free resources**. If you’re an
experienced software developer already, feel free to save yourself the time and
do something else. Otherwise, read on :).

> “The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step” — Lao Tzu

### Introduction

Before you get started, I need to warn you: Unfortunately, **programming is not
for everyone**, at least not if you want to stand out.

1.  It requires immense dedication. I mean, forever. I am a software developer for
11 years now and my “learning list” keeps getting bigger instead of the
opposite. You are either willing to be a forever student, or you should be
considering something else.
1.  It requires passion. Of course you don’t have to feel passionate right now,
you’re just getting started, but it has to happen somewhere down the road.
Otherwise you’re going to be mercilessly left behind by those who are.
1.  It’s challenging and a lot of people get burned out. Oftentimes you’ll be
dealing with long hours of “mentally taxing” work, impossible deadlines, legacy
unmaintainable code, inconsistent/ambiguous requirements and sub-optimal office
environments.
1.  It requires analytical thinking, good decision making, patience and curiosity,
lots of curiosity.
1.  It requires you to be **self-taught**. Yes, you can learn the theory from the
books, but when your code breaks, nobody is going to hold your hand.

With that in mind, since you’re still reading this, **I think you should really
try it**. Try it and see how it goes, and don’t feel frustrated if after some
time you don’t feel like it’s for you. I, for one, really enjoy being a
developer. I’m natural **builder**. Few things are more appealing to me than
creating and automating stuff. I find it extremely beautiful and rewarding, and
hopefully you will feel that way too :).

Also, the job market is definitely not bad and I don’t see it changing in the
foreseeable future. Radio, cable TV, education, brick-and-mortar stores and the
movie/music industries are examples of markets that will certainly be
transformed, if not completely defaced, by software in the next 20 years. The
future looks bright.

### How to become a developer

This is the list of free resources that will turn you into a software developer.
This is not going to be a walk in the park. This will be tough, there will be no
teacher holding your hand, you’ll probably regret it sometimes, but think twice
before giving up. Believe me.

### Where it all begins

#### [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!)

I know you’re excited and you can’t wait to see that brilliant idea in action
but please, hold on. The fundamentals are the most important part. Programming
languages and especially frameworks and libraries will come and go, but the
fundamentals will remain.

> “As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The
> man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who
tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble” — Harrington
Emerson

[CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!)
is a free course from Harvard provided by [Edx](https://www.edx.org/). It will
teach you the basics of how computers, programming languages, algorithms and
data-structures work and pave the way for the rest of your journey. You can take
this course for free and optionally get a certification for $90. After you
complete this one, you’ll be ready to move on.

### Getting your hands dirty

Once you’ve learned the principles with CS50x, now it’s time to put them in
practice.

> ― Aristotle

#### [Hackerrank](http://hackerrank.com/)

Hackerrank is a free online service that will provide you with hundreds of
algorithm problems and a platform on which you can implement solutions online
[using your favorite programming
language](https://www.hackerrank.com/environment). And the best part: It’s able
to check whether or not your solution is correct automatically. Here’s why
Hackerrank is an amazing tool:

1.  **It starts from the easy level **and progressively becomes more difficult as
you solve more problems.
1.  You can pick problems from a variety of “tracks”, depending on your interests.
Examples: SQL, Python, Artificial Intelligence, Functional Programming,
Security…
1.  It has “tutorial tracks” that actually include lessons. For instance, I highly
recommend [Cracking the Code
Interview](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview),
where [Gayle McDowell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaylemcd) gives a great
introduction on data structures and algorithms. **I find this track a great
follow up for CS50x**.
1.  Most of the jobs you will apply for, will require passing some sort of coding
challenge. That’s how they assess your problem solving skills. This process
often starts through an automated tool like [Codility](https://codility.com/) or
[Hackerrank](http://hackerrank.com/), before going to a real whiteboard. Having
solved lots of Hackerrank problems will definitely help you landing your first
job.

#### [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/)

[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/) is a platform similar to Hackerrank, but
you actually train your coding by “automating” video-games. The main difference
is that you get instant visual feedback from the code you are writing. CodinGame
may feel more exciting and appealing, while Hackerrank is still better for
actually learning the specific kinds of algorithms that companies look for in
interviews. Both are fantastic tools, nonetheless.

#### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) is an open-source community where
you learn how to code, especially web development, by completing a series of
self-paced challenges. It’s also possible to engage in real world projects for
non-profits. Also, the other “campers” seem to be very helpful along the way.

### Asking for help

[Stackoverflow ](http://stackoverflow.com/)is the biggest Q&A community about
software development, but there’re not known for being very receptive to
beginners. The best place to ask beginner’s questions is probably on
[/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming), but be sure to
read their [“Asking Questions
FAQ”](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index) beforehand. After
you get some confidence and experience,
[Stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) will be your best friend.

### Getting to the next level

#### [OSSU](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)

After you got yourself introduced to coding and trained a little, you may find
it interesting to delve into more advanced Computer Science topics like
Databases, Cryptography, Parallel Computing and so forth. Fortunately, there’s
[OSSU](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science). From their
website:

> This is a solid path for those of you who want to complete a Computer Science
> course on your own time, for free, with courses from the best universities in
the World.

You should definitely give it a try.

### The final frontier

#### [Google Interview
University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)

One day, a guy named [Josh Washam](https://twitter.com/startupnextdoor) got
obsessed about working at Google and made the world a favor by compiling [a
ginormous list with very useful resources about computer
science](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university). Apparently (or
not), this is what it takes to work for Google. From his website:

> I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics, but it grew to
> the large list you see today. Working at Google was the original motivator,
hence the name. [I didn’t get an interview at
Google](https://googleyasheck.com/i-didnt-get-hired-heres-why/), but the repo
name lives on, and it would mess up a lot of folks to change it now. The items
listed here will prepare you for a career at just about any software company,
including the giants: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.

As you can see, unfurtunately he didn’t get hired :(, but [his
work](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) will sure help
many others.

### Where to go from here

There’s an overwhelming amount of resources online about learning how to code,
but I think the best you can possibly find is this: [The top posts ever on

Subreddit. Amazing list. You’ll learn everything from Web Development, to Data
Science with Python, to Mobile development.
