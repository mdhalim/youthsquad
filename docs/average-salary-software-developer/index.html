<p><em>This post was updated on February 9, 2018</em></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been publishing our salary overview for three years in a row now. Last year&rsquo;s article proved to be rather popular among our readers. That&rsquo;s why we updated the information and are happy to present the most relevant data as of the beginning of 2018.</p>

<p>What follows is a salary comparison that includes the average annual incomes of software engineers in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, France, Israel, the UK, the US, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>We also provide a more detailed description of developer salaries in European countries depending on experience (entry-level, mid-career, and senior) and tech skills (Java, [C++][1], [C#][2], [.NET][3], [JavaScript][4], [PHP][5]).</p>

<p>The US is followed by Switzerland, which offers developers close to $86K per year. $70K is the average salary for Israel, Norway, and Denmark.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective, the average salary of a developer in [Ukraine][10], where we build, maintain, and retain software development teams for our clients, hovers around the $27K mark. Bear in mind though, that the actual annual income of Ukrainian software engineers can be much lower as well as significantly higher than this national average depending on the city they live in, their tech stack, and the level of experience they possess.</p>

<p>According to Indeed&rsquo;s [salary calculator][14], developer salaries in the US range from about $65,204 to $115,593, with a median of $92,240 per year.</p>

<p>![software-developer-salary-usa][15]</p>

<p>In terms of skills, C++ seems to pay the best out of the languages we researched — close to $116K annually. JavaScript developers make slightly less than that (around $110K). The average Java developer salary in the USA is $102K per year. However, developers who know several programming languages can expect higher salaries, which forces software engineers [learn][16] new skills continuously.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that although we didn&rsquo;t include Python in this overview, we conducted a separate piece of research on [Python developer salaries in the US][17] a while ago. Our results showed that the US national average for Python engineers is nearly $110K per year.</p>

<h2 id="tech-salary-trends-for-2018">Tech Salary Trends for 2018</h2>

<p>As the need for technical skills continues to grow and the supply of tech talent remains lower than the demand, IT workers will continue to negotiate higher wages. In the US, for one, the tech salaries in 2018 are expected to increase by [nearly 3%][49] on average.</p>

<p>The [2018 Robert Half Technology Salary Guide][50] forecasts that the salaries of C++, AJAX, PHP, and .NET developers will increase by 5–10% in 2018. However, the increase will differ from state to state. While engineers in Minnesota will enjoy a pay raise of about 6%, North Carolina developers will experience no positive salary shifts.</p>
